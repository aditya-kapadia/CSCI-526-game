Created for the group Night Rangers.
Some basic rules to use here:

1. **Do Not Push to Master Branch. Create your own branch push code and add 2-3 people as reviewers. Once done then only code will be merged to master**
2. Please provide enough comments and necessary readme files whenever and wherever possible.
3. Lets work together to have a clean and neat code structure.

Basic Mechanics of the Game -
* Player needs to place bricks and jump on those bricks to reach the destination
  * Once the player jumps on a brick, they cannot move the brick. This is to avoid reusing stable bricks as a hack
* We have multiple different types of bricks:
  * Stable bricks - these bricks donâ€™t move at all
  * Falling bricks - the player can only stand on these bricks for a limited amount of time, after this the brick will fall and the player will die
  * Floating bricks - these bricks will stay on either the x or y-axis that the player places it on, but will move back-and-forth
  * Black Hole - Once the player enters the portal from one end he directly teleports to the other end. It engulfs the player when he gets too close to it.
* There are other types of enemies that the player may face: aliens, UFOs, meteor showers, etc.
